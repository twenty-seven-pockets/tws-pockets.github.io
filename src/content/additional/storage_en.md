# Storage 

##### Temperature 
 Store the product at a stable room temperature, preferably between 15°C and 25°C. Avoid extreme heat or cold as this may affect the consistency and stability of the ingredients.

##### Light 
 Keep the product in a cool, dark place, and avoid direct sunlight. Light exposure can cause sensitive ingredients to degrade faster, shortening the product's shelf life.

##### Airtight Seal 
 Ensure that the container or packaging is tightly sealed to prevent air from entering and oxidizing the ingredients. This can help maintain the quality of the product and prevent contamination.

##### Hygiene 
 Ensure that the container or packaging is clean and free from contaminants. Use clean utensils or clean hands when dispensing the product to avoid contamination.

##### Prevent Separation 
 Some products may separate during prolonged storage, especially if they contain different phases such as oil and water. Before use, shake or stir the product well to ensure an even mixture.
