Kussy strives not only to enable mindful and respectful experiences but also to embody these principles in its own conduct. Environmental mindfulness and sustainability are relevant issues that we are committed to addressing.


# Sourcing

In line with our responsibility towards nature and people, Kussy aims to use only local products or those from the EU, ensuring we are aware of the exact origin of the ingredients. Currently, we are in the process of planning our suppliers, so more detailed information will follow later.



# Enviroment

The environment plays a significant role, especially in sustainability. In this context, implementing environmentally friendly production chains and ingredients is becoming increasingly important. Our company is committed to taking on this responsibility. We cooperate with companies based in Germany or the EU. This not only shortens the supply chains but also reduces the corresponding CO2 emissions.

# Packaging

Another aspect that creates a mindful and sustainable context is the design of the packaging for Kussy-Lips.

We want these qualities to be reflected in the packaging as well. We aim to minimize the use of plastic, with the main focus being on glass for the container. Additionally, wood sourced from local production facilities will be used. The packaging will be completed with an iron clasp closure and a silicone sealing ring. Currently, we are still in the planning phase and aim to replace the silicone ring with a sustainable alternative.


Planned components include:

- Bamboo Wood (Phyllostachys edulis)
- Glass
- Silicone
- Iron (Clasp)
