Hey there,

I'm Henrik, the founder of **Kussy**.

On my journey through life, I've come to embrace the concept of empowerment. It's about seeing each of us as capable beings, fully able to realize our potential when provided with the right resources. With my product and company, I aim to spread this idea far and wide. The focus is on giving you the freedom to explore new facets and flavors of yourself and your partner, all with the help of natural products.

Sending sunny regards,
