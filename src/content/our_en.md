# Company Spirit

From Kussy's perspective, we inhabit a world of myriad facets. Beyond the impressive high-tech or complex processes that are part of our society, nature itself offers an immense complexity. Kussy values this complexity and seeks to harness it to empower humanity.

The goal of Kussy's products is to bring out the potentials and nuances within us without resorting to heavily chemically altered products. These natural products accompany you as you explore new facets of your life and delight in sharing them with others, while enlivening your individual characteristics.

Additionally, our commitment to nature is paramount. We aim to give back to our environment, while also creating opportunities for the future. Therefore, a portion of our profits is dedicated to improving local environmental conditions. Examples of this can be found under "Sustainability."

# Founders


Hey there,

I'm Henrik, the founder of **Kussy**.

On my journey through life, I've come to embrace the concept of empowerment. It's about seeing each of us as capable beings, fully able to realize our potential when provided with the right resources. With my product and company, I aim to spread this idea far and wide. The focus is on giving you the freedom to explore new facets and flavors of yourself and your partner, all with the help of natural products.

Sending sunny regards,
