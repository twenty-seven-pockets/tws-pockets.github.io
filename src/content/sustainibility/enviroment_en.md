# Enviroment
The environment plays a significant role, especially in sustainability. In this context, implementing environmentally friendly production chains and ingredients is becoming increasingly important. Our company is committed to taking on this responsibility. We cooperate with companies based in Germany or the EU. This not only shortens the supply chains but also reduces the corresponding CO2 emissions.
