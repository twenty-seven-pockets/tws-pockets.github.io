# Packaging


Another aspect that creates a mindful and sustainable context is the design of the packaging for Kussy-Lips.

We want these qualities to be reflected in the packaging as well. We aim to minimize the use of plastic, with the main focus being on glass for the container. Additionally, wood sourced from local production facilities will be used. The packaging will be completed with an iron clasp closure and a silicone sealing ring. Currently, we are still in the planning phase and aim to replace the silicone ring with a sustainable alternative.

Planned components include:
- Bamboo Wood (Phyllostachys edulis)
- Glass
- Silicone
- Iron (Clasp)
